\section{Introduction}

[SMT solvers now handle quantifiers]

[Important in Applications]

The use of quantified formulas is highly important in a number of applications,
including automated theorem proving, software verification, synthesis, and planning.

[Challenging in Theories]

[Handled well in Practice]
In spite of the theoretical challenges, many uses of quantified formulas
can be handled well in practice by modern automated theorem provers and SMT solvers.

[Overview]

\section{Support for Quantified Formulas in an SMT Solver}

Most modern SMT solvers are based on the DPLL($T$) solving architecture,
where a set of decision procedures for $T$ are modularly combined with a SAT solver for propositional satisfiability~\cite{}.
Given a set of $T$-formulas $\Gamma$ as input to a DPLL($T$)-based SMT solver, its underlying SAT solver
abstracts each $T$-literal in $\Gamma$ as unique Boolean variable.
The SAT solver clausifies $\Gamma$ and returns that 
either $\Gamma$ is propositionally unsatisfiable (in which case it is also $T$-unsatisfiable),
or returns a set of literals $M$ that propositionally entail it.
We write $M \models_p \Gamma$ to denote this case, and refer to $M$ as a satisfying assignment for $\Gamma$.
It then uses a decision procedure for $T$ to
check the $T$-satisfiability of $M$, that is, whether there exists of model of $M$ that is consistent according to theory $T$.
If $M$ is $T$-satisfiable, then we may conclude that $\Gamma$ is $T$-satisfiable.
Otherwise, it returns a subset $C$ of $M$ that is $T$-unsatisfiable and adds the clause $\neg C$ to $\Gamma$,
which is often referred to as a conflict clause.

%In DPLL($T$), each theory literal and closed universally quantified formula is abstracted as a unique Boolean variable.
%The underlying SAT solver 

DPLL($T$)-based SMT solvers have been extended in the past decade with approaches for univeral and existential quantification~\cite{}.
For consistency, in this paper we assume all existential quantification is rewritten to universal quantification by the rewrite:
\[
\exists \vec x\, P( \vec x ) \transform \neg \forall \vec x\, \neg P( \vec x )
\]
In a DPLL($T$)-based approach for quantified formulas, 
each closed (universally) quantified formula is abstracted as a Boolean variable by the SAT solver as well.

\begin{example}
Consider the set of $UFLIA$-formulas:

\end{example}


\begin{comment}
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $\Gamma$ is propositionally unsatisfiable
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\ ] return ``unsat".
\end{enumerate}
\item[\ ] Otherwise, let $M$ be a set of literals such that $M \models_p \Gamma$.
\item[\ ] If $M$ is $T$-unsatisfiable
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\ ] return $\funcsmtsolve( \Gamma \cup \neg C )$ for some $T$-unsatisfiable $C \subseteq M$.
\end{enumerate}
\item[\ ] Otherwise, let $( r, L ) = \funcqi( M \backslash \quants{M}, \quants{M} )$.
\item[\ ] If $r$ is ``unknown"
\begin{enumerate}
\item[\ ] return $\funcsmtsolve( \Gamma \cup L )$.
\end{enumerate}
\item Otherwise, return ``sat".
\end{enumerate}
\end{comment}

\caption{An abstract procedure for $T$-inputs $\Gamma_0$ with quantified formulas in an SMT solver.
In Line 5, $E$ is quantifier-free, and the atoms of each literal in $Q$ are universally quantified formulas.
\label{fig:smtq}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:smtq} gives an abstract procedure $\funcsmtsolve$
for establishing the $T$-satisfiability of a set of $T$-formulas $\Gamma$ possibly containing universal quantification.
Lines 2 through 6 correspond to a DPLL($T$)-based approach for quantifier-free inputs.
In Line 5, we partition $M$ into two parts $E$ and $Q$,
where $E$ is quantifier-free and the atoms of literals in $Q$ are universally quantified formulas.
If the quantifier-free portion is $T$-satisfiable,
we proceed to Line 7, which invokes the procedure $\funcqi$ on $E$ and $Q$.
Abstractly, this procedure either may determine that $E \cup Q$ is $T$-satisfiable and return the pair $( \text{``sat"}, \emptyset )$,
or otherwise will return ( ``unknown", $L$ ), where $L$ is a set of formulas that are valid in theory $T$,
after which the procedure $\funcsmtsolve$ either terminates with ``sat" or adds $L$ to $\Gamma$ and repeats.

Designing support for quantified formulas in DPLL($T$)-based SMT solvers 
thus depends on how the function $\funcsmtsolve$ is implemented.
When doing so, recurrent questions include:
\begin{itemize}
\item How can we establish that $E \cup Q$ is $T$-satisfiable (when $Q$ is non-empty)?
\item What lemmas $L$ should we return?
\end{itemize}
The remainder of this paper will focus on these questions.

It is important to note that some SMT approaches to quantified formulas~\cite{}
reason about quantified formulas \emph{eagerly} during the DPLL($T$) search.
In terms of Figure~\ref{fig:smtq}, these approaches invoke $\funcqi$
for sets $M$ that are incomplete and do not necessarily propositinally entail all formulas in $\Gamma$.
The advantage of doing so is that lemmas returned by $\funcqi$ may help prune the search,
while the disadvantage is that calling $\funcqi$ may be expensive and lead to non-termination.
For simplicity, we assume a lazy approach for handling quantified formulas in this paper.
